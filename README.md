# React Native Spotify Login

Updated Repo with Nodejs integrated server

1. You need to create an expo account

2. You will need two terminal windows open, one for your expo cli and the other for your nodejs server

3. 
```
npm install
```

4. 
```
npm run ios
```

5. 
In other terminal window

```
node server.js
```

If you can't find your expo redirect url to add to your spotify application and to the ```server.js``` file look in your console because I am console logging it for you so it is easier to find.
